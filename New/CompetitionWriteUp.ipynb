    "# Competition and density dependent mortality\n",
    "\n",
    "Density dependent mortality is one of the primary regulatory mechanims for fish populations and can effect the performance of stocking programs. Competition between hatchery and wild fish can reduce the natrual productivity of popuatlions that are suplimented by hatcheries, reducing the over all effectiness of stocking effort at increasing the abundace of the population. These mechanisms can also interact with the genetic effects of hatcheyr programs, becuase if competition reduces natural production then the reletive contribution of the hatchery to the total popuatlion will be higher increasing the strength of genetic effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of mechanisms can lead to density dependent regualtion of natural populations, however, fish popualtions are often regualted by density dependence mortality during early life stages (Lorenzen 2019). For White sturgeon in particular, density dependent mortality seems to be most prevelent in the first year of life (Justice et al 2009). \n",
    "\n",
    "Understainding when density dependent mortaltiy occurs in the life cycle can inform hatcheyr managment practices, since there may be an advantage to release hatcheyr raised individuals after this bottle neck to increase their survival and to minimize competition with natrual born individuals. It is also important to understand which life stages are competing with eachother. Density dependent mortaltiy may only occur during particualrly vulnerable life stages, but these young individuals may be competing with other age classes. Justice et al. (2009) provides some evidence that this may be the case for White sturgeon in the Kootnie river where survival of age one individuals has a negative relationship with the total number of juviniles sturgeon in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, releasing hathcery fish at older life stages may improve their survival but would not nessicarily reduce or eleimiate their competitive effects on natrual recruitment. In this document my goal will be to develop that describe the competition between cohorts with in a population with the goal of understanding when hatcherr production can reduce natrual production, and how the age at which hatcheyr fish are released effects these outcomes.

    "## Phenominological models of competition\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way to model density dependent mortality is to assume a functional form that relates survival rates to the density of the popuatlion without focusing on the biological mechanisms that might cause that relationship to arise. This type of model is called phenominological. In constructing these models I make two key assumptions the first is that I assume the survival of age on individuals depends on the densioty of all cohorts in the popualtion including their own, but that the effect of each cohort depend on their age. These effects may change as each cohort ages becuase they may move to differnt habitats of consume differnt resources as they age, reducing the competitive effect or they may consume more as they grow increasign the competitive effect. To accomidate this I assume that the survival of age one indivduals depend on the weighted sum of all other cohorts. This gives a generic relationship between abundace and recruitment\n",

    "The second of these two equations is designed to show that the amount of density independnt mortlatiy effect the weight given to the age zero class, there fore it is important to choose this paramter carefully in these mechanistic models. For example, a sturgeon population may produce hundredes of thousands of eggs for only a few dozen recruits. This means that $p_0$ would be very small and if $b_0$ was one the same scale as the values for teh other age classes then nearly all of the weight would be given to this age class. However, this may not be realistic, and if for example density a significant part of the denstiy independent mortaltiy occured before density dependent mortaltiy it may make more sense to think about the contributio of th age zero class to density interms of its abundace after denstiy independent mortality occurs.  \n",

    "In both models the inital response to stocking is a decline in natrual recruitment caused by the increase in density dependent mortality. In the disk equaiton model  this is only temporary and over the course of about one generation the effect of increased reproduction from the hatcheyr fish offsets the increase in density dependent mortaltiy. In the exponential decay model this there is not recovery of natrual recruitment, it stays depressed over the course of the stocking program and the inital response to stocking is more severe. \n",

    "Another aproach to developing a model of density dependence is to explicitly model competition and survival based on a set of mechanistic assumptions. This can be valuable because it links the choice in functional form used in the model to a set of biological processes which at least in principal can be tested. In the next section I derive a mechanistic models of denstiy dependent mortality and competition with the goal of demostrating that under plausible biological assumptions we can arrive at models that have qualitativly similar behavior to both phenominolicial models. \n",

    "\n",
    "The basic model assumptions are intended to represent a scenario where individuals within a popualtion compete for food during a growing season. Their ability to consume food determines their pysiological state during a critical period in the year where a significant fraction of mortality occurs. I assume that individuals with higher physiological state (e.g. size) are more likely to survive. The exact assumptions and functional form that I choose are primarily selected for convenience this should be interpeted as more of a sketch the ilustrate what types of ynamics are possible rather than an accurate description of a specific biological system."
